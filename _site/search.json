This was in collaboration with the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (Cefas), British Antarctic Survey (BAS) and the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research (IMR).\nMy research focused on describing patterns in the ecology of seamounts in the South Atlantic, linking these with environmental parameters, and incorporating this baseline information into products that support science-based decision making regarding management regimes.\n\nKey methodologies I employed included:\n\nUni- and multivariate statistical analysis of ecological data (e.g. generalised additive models, general linear mixed effects models, distance-based linear models, non-metric multidimensional scaling)\nHabitat suitability modelling (HSM)\nBroad-scale, non-hierarchical habitat classification"
