    "title": "Performance of Deep-Sea Habitat Suitability Models Assessed Using Independent Data, and Implications for Use in Area-Based Management",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nMarine spatial management requires accurate data on species and habitat distributions. In the deep sea, these data are lacking. Habitat suitability modelling offers a robust defensible means to fill data gaps, provided models are sufficiently reliable. We test the performance of published models of two deep-sea habitat-forming taxa at low and high resolutions (~1 km and 200 m grid-cell size), across the extended EEZs of UK and Ireland. We construct new data-rich models and compare new and old estimates of the area of habitat protected, noting changes in the protected area network since 2015. Results of independent validation suggest all published models perform worse than expected considering original cross-validation results, but model performance is still good or fair for Desmophyllum pertusum reef, with poorer performance for Pheronema carpenteri sponge models. High-resolution models using multibeam data out-perform low-resolution GEBCO-based models. Newly constructed models are good to excellent according to cross-validation. New model spatial predictions reflect published models, but with a significant reduction in predicted extent. The current marine protected area network and the European Union ban on bottom trawling below 800m protect 40% and 60% of D. pertusum reef-suitable habitat respectively, and 11% and 100% of P. carpenteri suitable habitat respectively within the model domain. We conclude high-resolution models of D. pertusum reef distribution are a useful tool in spatial management. The poorer performing P. carpenteri model indicate areas for more detailed study. Whilst low-resolution models can provide conservative estimates of percentage area-based conservation targets following the precautionary principle, high-resolution sea-floor mapping supports the development of better-performing models."

    "title": "Climate Mitigation through Biological Conservation: Extensive and Valuable Blue Carbon Natural Capital in Tristan da Cunha’s Giant Marine Protected Zone",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nCarbon-rich habitats can provide powerful climate mitigation if meaningful protection is put in place. We attempted to quantify this around the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Area. Its shallows (<1000 m depth) are varied and productive. The 5.4 km2 of kelp stores ~60 tonnes of carbon (tC) and may export ~240 tC into surrounding depths. In deep-waters we analysed seabed data collected from three research cruises, including seabed mapping, camera imagery, seabed oceanography and benthic samples from mini-Agassiz trawl. Rich biological assemblages on seamounts significantly differed to the islands and carbon storage had complex drivers. We estimate ~2.3 million tC are stored in benthic biodiversity of waters <1000 m, which includes >0.22 million tC that can be sequestered (the proportion of the carbon captured that is expected to become buried in sediment or locked away in skeletal tissue for at least 100 years). Much of this carbon is captured by cold-water coral reefs as a mixture of inorganic (largely calcium carbonate) and organic compounds. As part of its 2020 Marine Protection Strategy, these deep-water reef systems are now protected by a full bottom-trawling ban throughout Tristan da Cunha and representative no take areas on its seamounts. This small United Kingdom Overseas Territory’s reef systems represent approximately 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalent sequestered carbon; valued at >£24 Million GBP (at the UN shadow price of carbon). Annual productivity of this protected standing stock generates an estimated £3 million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized and potentially major component of the economy of small island nations like Tristan da Cunha. Conservation of near intact habitats are expected to provide strong climate and biodiversity returns, which are exemplified by this MPA."

    "title": "Benthic Assemblage Composition of South Atlantic Seamounts",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nSeamounts and oceanic islands rise from the seafloor and provide suitable habitat for a diverse range of biological assemblages including Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). Whilst they have been the focus of some work globally, there has been little description of the biological and physical environments of seamounts in the South Atlantic Ocean. In this study, we characterized benthic assemblage composition from 13 seamounts and oceanic islands spanning 8–40°S within the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of Ascension Island, Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha. Drop camera imagery was collected between 170 and 1000 m. All fauna present in images were identified and quantified, and multivariate statistics were used to describe biological assemblages and identify their environmental drivers. Benthic communities of temperate regions (Tristan da Cunha archipelago) were shown to be distinct from those found in the tropics, with latitude and depth identified as key environmental drivers of assemblage composition. Our results are consistent with the current understanding of the biogeography of the South Atlantic, both in terms of the distinction between tropical and temperate regions, and the influence of depth and water mass structure on assemblage distribution. Faunal assemblages are similar to those observed in the North Atlantic in terms of functional groups. VMEs are present within the EEZs of all three territories and are potentially protected from some threats by large marine protected areas (MPAs). Our imagery, data and analyses provide a baseline for south Atlantic seamounts so that future monitoring can establish whether existing protected status is sufficient to conserve both unique biodiversity and considerable potential for vital ecosystem services."

    "title": "Depth and Latitudinal Gradients of Diversity in Seamount Benthic Communities",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nLatitudinal and bathymetric species diversity gradients in the deep sea have been identified, but studies have rarely considered these gradients across hard substratum habitats, such as seamount and oceanic island margins. This study aimed to identify whether the current understanding of latitudinal and bathymetric gradients in α-diversity (species richness) apply to seamount ecosystems, as well as ascertaining whether identifiable trends were present in seamount β-diversity along a bathymetric gradient. Images from 39 transects, collected between 250 and 950 m in the Exclusive Economic Zones of Saint Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha, were used to characterise species richness. General linear models were applied to test possible environmental drivers across latitudinal and bathymetric ranges. Regression models were also employed to investigate the β-diversity gradient of species turnover with depth. Transects in temperate latitude had significantly higher species richness than those in the tropics. Surface primary productivity and substrate hardness both had significant positive effects on species richness, and a weak relationship between temperature and species richness was observed. No significant relationship between species richness and depth was detected, but there was significant species turnover with depth. Seamounts and oceanic islands do not conform to established depth–diversity relationships within the depth range studied. However, seamounts and oceanic islands in the South Atlantic do appear to follow a parabolic latitudinal diversity gradient, closely associated with higher productivity in temperate regions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nBluenose warehou (Hyperoglyphe antarctica) is a popular commercial fish in Australia and New Zealand, but its biology and ecology are very poorly known in other regions where it is found. We present here the first life history data for this species from the south Atlantic, focusing upon the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the United Kingdom Overseas Territory (UKOT) of Tristan da Cunha (TdC). Here, bluenose is known from several seamounts and island margins, typically occurring in waters between 200 and 1,000 m depth and is the target species of trawl and longline fishery operating since 1997. We use a suite of methods to describe important life history parameters, including length-weight and age-length relationships and size at recruitment, as well as examining commercial longline survey data to uncover habitat preferences of bluenose. This work has formed an important part of the United Kingdom government’s Blue Belt Program in TdC. It has underpinned the development of the first stock assessment for this species in the Atlantic, as well as a range of improved conservation measures for some of the more vulnerable species that occur in these areas, including seabirds and cold-water corals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIdentifying and understanding environmental drivers of deep-sea sponge aggregations is critical for effective protection and management. Current literature suggests an association between internal wave activity, regions of enhanced currents, and the distribution of deep-sea sponge aggregations. It is hypothesised that sponges utilise particulate organic matter associated with internal waves and enhanced currents and therefore aggregate in these regions. Random Forest algorithms – as well as preliminary Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) – were fitted to the presence-pseudo-absence and density datasets to characterise the relationship with each environmental variable. Additionally, residual autocovariate variables were calculated and included in models to account for spatial autocorrelation. All variables were statistically significant when GAMs were fitted to the presence-pseudo-absence datasets, but spatial autocorrelation could not be successfully accounted for. In contrast, a Random Forest model was fitted that also successfully accounted for spatial autocorrelation. No relationships were detected when GAMs were fitted to the density dataset – results confirmed by a poorly performing Random Forest model. Our findings suggest that average temperature variability is an important driver of P. carpenteri distribution and should be incorporated into habitat suitability models. However, available environmental data do not capture key drivers of P. carpenteri density, limiting our ability to model, and therefore identify areas where aggregations are likely to occur. This may reflect a mismatch in the spatial scales in which environmental and biological processes occur. We conclude that further research is required, particularly into feeding strategy and reproduction, to identify missing drivers of P. carpenteri density."
